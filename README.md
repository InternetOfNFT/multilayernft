# multilayernft
The Multilayer Image Creation Program is a steganography application that encodes the pixels of an image using inputted text and matches them with ASCII equivalents. This program allows you to hide your texts within your images. It is the first phase of a project we initiated to diversify the use of NFTs, and you will be able to access the contents of the images on our Opensea address through this demo software. The PNG versions of these images can be found in our folder named "NFT Collection." You can access the content of your owned NFT from here.

The MultilayerNFT software is a small introductory demo of a larger whole. Our goal is to implement a protocol called "Internet of NFT" (a protocol where NFTs can communicate independently and carry data over the internet). The Multilayer NFT software represents a simple example of the basic workings of this system. For detailed information on the subject, you can visit our Twitter handle (@IONprotocols) or explore the relevant section within the application.

# SETUP FILE
To install the program as setup, enter the debug folder in the Multilayer NFT 1.0 folder. You can install it with Setup.exe
